# Problem Statement

### 1. User Authentication

- **Sign Up**: Allow users to sign up using email, Google, or other providers supported by Clerk.
- **Login**: Enable users to log in with their credentials.
- **Logout**: Provide an option for users to log out of the application.
- **Session Management**: Ensure secure session management using Clerk's authentication services.

### 2. Real-Time Collaboration

- **Whiteboard Canvas**: Users should be able to draw and manipulate graphics on a shared canvas in real time.
- **Multi-User Interaction**: Allow multiple users to interact with the whiteboard simultaneously, seeing each other's changes in real time.
- **Undo/Redo**: Implement features for users to undo and redo their actions.
- **Clear Canvas**: Provide an option to clear the entire canvas.
- **Color Picker**: Include a color picker for users to select different colors for drawing.
- **Brush Size**: Allow users to adjust the size of the brush or pencil they are using.
- **Eraser Tool**: Implement an eraser tool to remove drawings.

### 3. WebSocket Integration

- **Real-Time Communication**: Use WebSockets to facilitate real-time communication between clients and the server, ensuring that all changes made by one user are instantly reflected to others connected to the same canvas.
- **Message Broadcasting**: Implement a mechanism for broadcasting messages (e.g., when a new user joins or an action is performed) to all connected users.

### 4. Data Persistence and Synchronization

- **Sync Across Devices**: Ensure that data is synchronized across different devices, allowing users to switch between desktop and mobile without losing their work.
- **Version Control**: Implement version control for undo/redo functionality, ensuring that changes can be tracked over time.

### 5. User Interface (UI)

- **Responsive Design**: Create a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Use interactive elements like buttons and sliders to facilitate interaction with the whiteboard.
- **Notifications**: Show notifications for actions taken by other users, such as joining or leaving the session.

### 6. Customization

- **Theme Support**: Allow users to switch between dark and light themes.
- **User Settings**: Provide a settings page where users can adjust preferences like theme, brush size, etc.

### 7. Security and Privacy

- **Data Encryption**: Ensure that all data transmitted over WebSockets is encrypted.
- **Privacy Controls**: Implement privacy controls to allow users to manage their visibility on the whiteboard (e.g., hide or show other users' cursors).

### 8. Performance Optimization

- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimize rendering for large canvases by implementing lazy loading and throttling updates during heavy activity periods.
- **Reduced Latency**: Minimize latency in data transfer between the client and server to ensure smooth real-time interactions.

### 9. Accessibility

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions like clearing the canvas, changing colors, etc.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Ensure that screen readers can interact with the application effectively, providing an inclusive experience for all users.

### 10. Error Handling and Logging

- **Error Reporting**: Implement error handling to manage issues gracefully and provide useful feedback to users.
- **Logging**: Log actions and events for debugging purposes and ensuring transparency in user activities.
